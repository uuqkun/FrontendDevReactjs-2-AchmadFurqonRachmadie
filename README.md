# Restaurant App

This is a simple React application that displays a list of restaurants. It has 3 different filter features, those are filter by open status, price, and categories. I'm implenting CSR (Client Side Rendering) for open status and price filter, also SSR (Server Side Rendering) for categories feature.

The application was built using the following technologies: 
- ReactJS v18.0.0
- Node v16.14.0
- TailwindCSS 3.3.5
- Vite v4.4.5
